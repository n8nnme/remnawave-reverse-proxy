# REMNAWAVE-REVERSE-PROXY ([Russian](/README-RU.md))
### Server Using NGINX Reverse Proxy
This script is designed for quick setup of a reverse proxy server based on NGINX in combination with Xray. In this setup, Xray operates directly on port 443, redirects to a socket, and NGINX listens to it, eliminating unnecessary TCP overhead. This approach enhances connection performance and stability.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script has been tested in a KVM virtualization environment. For proper operation, you will need your own domain, which must be linked to Cloudflare. It is recommended to run the script with root privileges on a freshly installed system.

### CLOUDFLARE Configuration
1. Configure Cloudflare:
   - Link your domain to Cloudflare.
   - Add the following DNS records:

| Type  | Name              | Content          | Proxy status  |
| ----- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| A     | example.com       | your_server_ip   | DNS only      |
| CNAME | panel.example.com | example.com      | DNS only      |
| CNAME | sub.example.com   | example.com      | DNS only      |

2. SSL/TLS settings in Cloudflare:

2. NGINX reverse proxy setup in combination with Xray.
3. Security measures:
   - Configuration of Cloudflare SSL certificates with automatic renewal to secure connections.
   - UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) setup for access management.
   - Disabling IPv6 to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
   - Selecting a random website template from an array.
